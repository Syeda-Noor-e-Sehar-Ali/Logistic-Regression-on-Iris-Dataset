# Logistic-Regression-on-Iris-Dataset
This project enabels you to perform logistic regression on iris dataset.Load the Iris dataset and select relevant features. Split the data into training and test sets. Initialize weights and bias, then compute predictions using the sigmoid function. Use log-loss as the cost function to measure accuracy. Calculate gradients of the cost function and update parameters iteratively using gradient descent. Train the model for a set number of iterations or until the cost function converges
